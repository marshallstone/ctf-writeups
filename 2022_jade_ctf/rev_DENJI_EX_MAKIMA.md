Nick is a huge anime fan. Recently, he started watching チェンソーマン and got really fascinated by it.
He couldn't wait for the new episodes, and downloaded an application which would "apparently" get him all the episodes straight away.
Sadly, it turned out to be a malware, and encrypted all the files in his system.
He needs your help. Provided is the malware and one of his files.

WARNING! THIS CHALLENGE CONTAINS A LIVE MALWARE

We are provided with two files: "FILE.fun" and "ChainsawMan_Downloader.zip (contains a binary)".
